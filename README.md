Avocado Toast is our technology podcast in Chinese. This is the source code that builds the podcast's static website on [https://avocadotoast.live/](https://avocadotoast.live/). If you are interested in helping us improve the website, you come to the right place. Feel free to open new issues and contribute your own code. (If you are a listener of our podcast, you can join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/avocadotoastlisteners) to chat with us.)

## What do I need?

You need to have Git, [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) set up on your computer. I assume you have basic Git skills and know how to write JavaScript for Node.

### What do I need for Windows?

If you are using Windows, follow [Microsoft's step-by-step guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-windows) to set up Node and NVM for Windows.

## Where do I start?

Start with cloning this repository. Then get into the directory, set Node to the correct version and use Yarn to install dependencies. Set environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `development`. Start a local server with Yarn. Now you can modify the code and see your change locally.

```
git clone git@github.com:avocadotoastlive/avocadotoast.live
